The complexity of this project goes beyond what I can meaningfully respond to in a short note like this, and we've had enough conversations in class that I feel comfortable with where you are as we look toward the final submission. This is excellent work, and I appreciate that, since you came into the course with some knowledge of Python already, you didn't just create something simple, but really engaged in the project.
